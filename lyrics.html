        [Verse 3: Agnetha Fältskog]
        But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you?
        Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
        Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you
        But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed
        
        [Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog & Anni-Frid Lingstad]
        The judges will decide (They decide)
        The likes of me abide (We abide)
        Spectators of the show (Of the show)
        Always stayin' low (Staying low)
        The game is on again (On again)
        A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
        A big thing or a small (Big or small)
        The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
        
        [Bridge: Agnetha Fältskog]
        I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
        And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
        I apologise if it makes you feel bad
        Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
        But you see, the winner takes it all
        The winner takes it all
        
        [Outro: Anni-Frid Lingstad]
        (So the winner takes it all)
        (And the loser has to fall)
        (Throw a dice, cold as ice)
        (Way down here, someone dear)
        (Takes it all, has to fall)
        (Yes, it's plain, why complain?)
        
        [Verse 3: Agnetha Fältskog]
        But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you?
        Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
        Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you
        But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed
        
        [Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog & Anni-Frid Lingstad]
        The judges will decide (They decide)
        The likes of me abide (We abide)
        Spectators of the show (Of the show)
        Always stayin' low (Staying low)
        The game is on again (On again)
        A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
        A big thing or a small (Big or small)
        The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
