        [Verse 1: Agnetha Fältskog]
I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus: Agnetha Fältskog]
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2: Agnetha Fältskog]
I was in your arms, thinkin' I belonged there
I figured it made sense building me a fence
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules
